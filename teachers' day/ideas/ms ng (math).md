Section 1: First lesson
"Ok class take out your math workbook, please copy down the scheldule for your tests and exams this year." Ms Ng, my mathematics teacher instructed. She wore a pair of red spectacles. One glance and you would be able to tell that shwe was very strict. " Ok, now we will be going through the..." she droned on. She would always speak very quickly, briefly explaining all the important details before moving on to the next. Despite this, we all listened on, without a sign of fatigue. This is because she managed to keep the lessons interesting, always talking in english before switching to chinese for no reason. ( I can't think of anymore stuff you're on your own from here)
